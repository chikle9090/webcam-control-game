# 🎮 Air Juggler – Webcam Hand-Controlled Game  

Control a game using **just your hands** — no keyboard, no mouse!  
This project uses **TensorFlow.js** and **MediaPipe Hands** to track hand movements in real-time using your webcam.

This is my custom-built version of the gesture-controlled game, with improvements, clean code, and my own UI flow.
